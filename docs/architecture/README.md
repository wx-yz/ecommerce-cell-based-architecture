# Cell-Based Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architecture documentation for the cell-based implementation.

## Architecture Principles

This implementation follows the cell-based architecture reference defined by WSO2, which emphasizes:

1. **Decentralized Architecture**: Moving away from centralized layers to independent cells
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Each cell represents a bounded context
3. **Independent Deployment**: Each cell can be deployed independently
4. **API-First Communication**: Well-defined contracts between cells
5. **Scalability**: Independent scaling of each cell
6. **Governance**: Controlled access and policies at cell boundaries
