# Cell Boundaries and Domain Definition

## Overview
This document defines the boundaries and responsibilities of each cell in the e-commerce application based on cell-based architecture principles.

## Cell Boundary Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design
Each cell represents a bounded context that encapsulates a specific business domain:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each cell has a clear, focused responsibility
- **Data Ownership**: Each cell owns its data and provides APIs for access
- **Independent Evolution**: Cells can evolve independently without affecting others

### 2. Conway's Law Alignment
Cell boundaries align with potential team boundaries:
- Each cell can be owned by a dedicated team
- Teams can work independently on their cell
- Cross-team coordination only required for API contracts

### 3. Minimal Inter-Cell Dependencies
Cell boundaries minimize external dependencies:
- High cohesion within cells
- Loose coupling between cells
- Well-defined API contracts

## Cell Definitions

### 1. Frontend Cell

## Cell Interaction Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- **Pattern**: Request-Response
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Frontend → Product Cell (product listing)
  - Frontend → Cart Cell (cart operations)
  - Order Cell → Payment Cell (payment processing)
  - Order Cell → Fulfillment Cell (shipping quotes)

### Asynchronous Communication
- **Pattern**: Event-Driven
- **Use Cases**:
  - Order placed events
  - Payment completed events
  - Shipping updates

### Data Ownership Rules

1. **Exclusive Ownership**: Each cell owns its data exclusively
2. **API Access**: Other cells access data only through APIs
3. **No Shared Databases**: Each cell has its own data storage
4. **Eventual Consistency**: Accept eventual consistency for cross-cell data

## Deployment Boundaries

### Independent Deployment
- Each cell can be deployed independently
- Versioned API contracts enable safe deployments
- Blue-green deployments per cell
- Canary releases per cell

### Scaling Boundaries
- Each cell can scale independently
- Resource allocation per cell
- Performance optimization per cell
- Monitoring and observability per cell

## Security Boundaries

### Trust Boundaries
- Each cell represents a security boundary
- Authentication and authorization at cell gateway
- Security policies per cell
- Secure communication between cells

### Data Protection
- Data encryption at rest per cell
- Data encryption in transit between cells
- PII handling per cell requirements
- Compliance per cell domain

## Governance

### API Contracts
- Versioned API contracts between cells
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Contract testing and validation
- API documentation and discovery

### Monitoring and Observability
- Distributed tracing across cells
- Metrics collection per cell
- Centralized logging with cell context
- Health checks per cell

### Development Process
- Independent development cycles per cell
- Team ownership per cell
- Code review and quality gates per cell
- CI/CD pipelines per cell
