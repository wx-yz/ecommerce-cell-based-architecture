# Cell Boundaries and Domain Definition\n\n## Overview\nThis document defines the boundaries and responsibilities of each cell in the e-commerce application based on cell-based architecture principles.\n\n## Cell Boundary Principles\n\n### 1. Domain-Driven Design\nEach cell represents a bounded context that encapsulates a specific business domain:\n- **Single Responsibility**: Each cell has a clear, focused responsibility\n- **Data Ownership**: Each cell owns its data and provides APIs for access\n- **Independent Evolution**: Cells can evolve independently without affecting others\n\n### 2. Conway's Law Alignment\nCell boundaries align with potential team boundaries:\n- Each cell can be owned by a dedicated team\n- Teams can work independently on their cell\n- Cross-team coordination only required for API contracts\n\n### 3. Minimal Inter-Cell Dependencies\nCell boundaries minimize external dependencies:\n- High cohesion within cells\n- Loose coupling between cells\n- Well-defined API contracts\n\n## Cell Definitions\n\n### 1. Frontend Cell\n**Domain**: User Experience\n**Bounded Context**: User interface and interaction\n**Components**: frontend, loadgenerator\n**Data Owned**: User sessions, UI state\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- User interface rendering\n- User session management\n- Client-side state management\n- Load testing capabilities\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: All other cells via HTTP/gRPC\n- Provides: Web UI, Health checks\n\n### 2. Product Cell\n**Domain**: Product Management\n**Bounded Context**: Product catalog and recommendations\n**Components**: productcatalogservice, recommendationservice\n**Data Owned**: Product catalog, recommendation models\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- Product information management\n- Product search and discovery\n- Personalized recommendations\n- Product metadata management\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: None (self-contained)\n- Provides: Product APIs, Recommendation APIs\n\n### 3. Cart Cell\n**Domain**: Shopping Cart\n**Bounded Context**: Cart operations and persistence\n**Components**: cartservice\n**Data Owned**: Cart items, user carts\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- Shopping cart management\n- Cart item persistence\n- Cart operations (add, remove, empty)\n- Cart state management\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: None (self-contained)\n- Provides: Cart APIs\n\n### 4. Order Cell\n**Domain**: Order Management\n**Bounded Context**: Order processing and orchestration\n**Components**: checkoutservice\n**Data Owned**: Order workflow state\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- Order processing workflow\n- Service orchestration\n- Business logic coordination\n- Order state management\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: Cart, Payment, Fulfillment, Platform APIs\n- Provides: Checkout APIs\n\n### 5. Payment Cell\n**Domain**: Payment Processing\n**Bounded Context**: Payment and financial transactions\n**Components**: paymentservice\n**Data Owned**: Payment transactions, payment state\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- Payment processing\n- Credit card validation\n- Transaction management\n- Payment security\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: None (self-contained)\n- Provides: Payment APIs\n\n### 6. Fulfillment Cell\n**Domain**: Order Fulfillment\n**Bounded Context**: Shipping and customer communication\n**Components**: shippingservice, emailservice\n**Data Owned**: Shipping quotes, email templates\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- Shipping cost calculations\n- Shipping address validation\n- Order confirmation emails\n- Customer notifications\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: None (self-contained)\n- Provides: Shipping APIs, Email APIs\n\n### 7. Marketing Cell\n**Domain**: Marketing and Advertising\n**Bounded Context**: Advertisements and promotions\n**Components**: adservice\n**Data Owned**: Ad content, targeting data\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- Contextual advertisement serving\n- Ad content management\n- Marketing campaign management\n- Click-through tracking\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: None (self-contained)\n- Provides: Advertisement APIs\n\n### 8. Platform Cell\n**Domain**: Shared Utilities\n**Bounded Context**: Cross-cutting concerns and utilities\n**Components**: currencyservice\n**Data Owned**: Currency rates, conversion data\n**Key Responsibilities**:\n- Currency conversion\n- Exchange rate management\n- Shared utility functions\n- Cross-cutting concerns\n\n**API Contracts**:\n- Consumes: External currency APIs\n- Provides: Currency APIs\n\n## Cell Interaction Patterns\n\n### Synchronous Communication\n- **Pattern**: Request-Response\n- **Use Cases**: \n  - Frontend → Product Cell (product listing)\n  - Frontend → Cart Cell (cart operations)\n  - Order Cell → Payment Cell (payment processing)\n  - Order Cell → Fulfillment Cell (shipping quotes)\n\n### Asynchronous Communication\n- **Pattern**: Event-Driven\n- **Use Cases**:\n  - Order placed events\n  - Payment completed events\n  - Shipping updates\n\n### Data Ownership Rules\n\n1. **Exclusive Ownership**: Each cell owns its data exclusively\n2. **API Access**: Other cells access data only through APIs\n3. **No Shared Databases**: Each cell has its own data storage\n4. **Eventual Consistency**: Accept eventual consistency for cross-cell data\n\n## Deployment Boundaries\n\n### Independent Deployment\n- Each cell can be deployed independently\n- Versioned API contracts enable safe deployments\n- Blue-green deployments per cell\n- Canary releases per cell\n\n### Scaling Boundaries\n- Each cell can scale independently\n- Resource allocation per cell\n- Performance optimization per cell\n- Monitoring and observability per cell\n\n## Security Boundaries\n\n### Trust Boundaries\n- Each cell represents a security boundary\n- Authentication and authorization at cell gateway\n- Security policies per cell\n- Secure communication between cells\n\n### Data Protection\n- Data encryption at rest per cell\n- Data encryption in transit between cells\n- PII handling per cell requirements\n- Compliance per cell domain\n\n## Governance\n\n### API Contracts\n- Versioned API contracts between cells\n- Backward compatibility requirements\n- Contract testing and validation\n- API documentation and discovery\n\n### Monitoring and Observability\n- Distributed tracing across cells\n- Metrics collection per cell\n- Centralized logging with cell context\n- Health checks per cell\n\n### Development Process\n- Independent development cycles per cell\n- Team ownership per cell\n- Code review and quality gates per cell\n- CI/CD pipelines per cell
